Wu Dong-Dong (吴东冬) is currently a second-year M.Eng. student in [School of computer science and engineering at Southeast University](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/). He is a member of [Pattern Learning and Mining Lab (PALM)](http://palm.seu.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Min-Ling Zhang](http://palm.seu.edu.cn/zhangml/). Wu Dongdong received his B.Eng. degree in [School of Big Data & Software Engineering at Chongqing University](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/) in Jun 2021. In the same year, he was admitted to study for an M.Eng. degree in Southeast University without entrance examination.

My research interest includes **machine learning and data mining** and **evidence theory** <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Vx3dZgAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. Specially now I am focusing on **partial label learning** and **noisy label learning**.
Interest Keywords include **distillation**, **knowledge**, **discriminative feature**, **CAM**, **image classification**, **complementary**, **noisy label**, **attention**, **data programming**, **instance-dependent**, **label smoothing**.

Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me (dongdongwu@seu.edu.cn).
